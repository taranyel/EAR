Travel forum for finding travel companions.
This system will provide travelers with a safe environment to communicate and plan joint trips.

## Purpose
The safe forum for travelers (instead of tons of weird Facebook groups).

## Safety
Email verification

## Trip planning
At the same time as the trip, a attendList is created to which the attendList admin (the user who created the trip) is automatically added. Kreří users who are interested in a trip "reply" to the trip (a question is sent to the admin about approval), after the question is approved by the admin, the interested person is added to the relevant attendList.

The application is intended for travelers and tour guides of all levels.
